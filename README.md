# Algorithms and Data Structures Notebooks

This repository contains implementations of classic algorithms and problem-solving techniques in Python using Jupyter Notebooks. Each notebook is self-contained and demonstrates the algorithm along with explanations and sample outputs.

## Notebooks Overview

### 1. `Fibonacci.ipynb`

* **Description:** Implements the Fibonacci sequence using multiple approaches including recursion, iteration, and dynamic programming.
* **Key Concepts:** Recursion, Dynamic Programming, Time Complexity Optimization.
* **Use Case:** Learning different methods to generate the Fibonacci sequence efficiently.

### 2. `Huffman Encoding.ipynb`

* **Description:** Demonstrates Huffman Encoding for data compression.
* **Key Concepts:** Greedy Algorithms, Priority Queue, Binary Tree, Data Compression.
* **Use Case:** Understanding how variable-length encoding can reduce storage space.

### 3. `Fractional Knapsack.ipynb`

* **Description:** Implements the Fractional Knapsack problem using a greedy approach.
* **Key Concepts:** Greedy Algorithm, Optimization, Fractional Selection.
* **Use Case:** Solving resource allocation problems where fractions of items can be taken.

### 4. `01 Knapsack.ipynb`

* **Description:** Solves the 0/1 Knapsack problem using dynamic programming.
* **Key Concepts:** Dynamic Programming, Optimization, Binary Selection.
* **Use Case:** Selecting items with maximum value without exceeding weight constraints.

### 5. `NQueen.ipynb`

* **Description:** Solves the N-Queen problem using backtracking.
